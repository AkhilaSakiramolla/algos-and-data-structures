# Algorithms and Data Structures 

This repository contains a collection of algorithm and data structures concepts in Python.

The folders in the repository contain the repective source code files for each of the implementations along with the corresponding results and output files.

Note: All the source codes are built in python and do not use any pre-existing libraries.

Below are some of the concepts covered in this repository:

  1) Merge sort
  2) Heap sort
  3) Counting sort
  4) Bucket sort
  5) Brute force pattern matching
  6) Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm
  7) Boyer-Moore algorithm
  8) Longest Common Sub-sequence (LCS) Problem
  9) Greedy algorithm
  10) Expectation-maximization algorithm
  11) Gaussian mixture models
 
 Please refer to the PDF and IPYNB files for detailed explanation!
